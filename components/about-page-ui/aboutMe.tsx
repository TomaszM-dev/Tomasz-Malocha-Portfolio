          Coding is like solving puzzles for me. It is creative and lets me
          build cool things from scratch. It is like being a wizard and making
          magic happen on the computer via numbers and strings (I am a fan of
          Harry Potter) üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Beyond coding, I am passionate about, philosophy,
          psychology, mindfullnes, reading, and weight lifting. I belive that
          healthy mind needs to be complemented with healthy body. &quot;To keep
          the body in good health is a duty... otherwise, we shall not be able
          to keep our mind strong and clear.&quot; - Thich Nhat Hanh. Oh wait Do
          I mentioned that I love philosophy? ü§î
